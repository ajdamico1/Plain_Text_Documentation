Arc faults are a major safety hazard when working with high voltage electrical equipment. They cause serious burn injuries to people. Thatâ€™s why many firms will label parts that can arc and why they are only handled by trained electricians.

Arc flashes are caused when dusts, tools, or when the material corrodes or faulty installation. They are flashovers of electric current that have left their intended path and arced offed into the air. They are dangerous to be around due to the high current being able to arc off into the nearby person. They are dangerous due to having a current too small to be protected by breakers.

They can be prevented by practicing good safety habits. Wearing proper protective equipment. As outlined by the NFPA. De-energize the circuit. Provide proper instruction on how to handle equipment that could cause an arc flash. Skills and techniques to identify live parts of circuit, determine nominal voltage of live parts, clearance specified by design firm, and the voltage that they will be exposing themselves to.

Arc flashes are calculated using the equations given by either IEEE or NFPA. Needed for the study are the expected minimum and maximum fault current as well as the expected minimum and maximum voltage. Many building design firms have measures in place for pointing out what parts can arc. Consulting firms can also be used when needed to double check the measurements. They can sometimes also provide training courses to help train electricians on how to handle materials that can arc.

The currents through arc faults are too low to be protected by breakers. This makes arc faults a serious burn/electrocution hazard. Arc fault analyses are used to ensure safety of the electricians. After proper investigation, any part that is arc fault will have a clear label and the proper protective equipment will be available. NFPA, and IEEE standards are used as the basis for proper arc fault investigation.
