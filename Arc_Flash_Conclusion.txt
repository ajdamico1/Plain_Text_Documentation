Original: The currents through arc fault are too low to be protected by breakers. This makes arc faults a serious burn/electrocution hazard that should be given serious consideration. Potential arc faulting equipment should be clearly labeled, and the proper protective equipment should be available to employees. OSHA, NFPA, and IEEE standards should be met. 
Revised: The currents through arc fault are too low to be protected by breakers. This makes arc faults a serious burn/electrocution hazard that should be given serious consideration. Arc fault analysis is important. Potential arc faulting equipment should be clearly labeled, and the proper protective equipment should be available to employees. OSHA, NFPA, and IEEE standards should be met.
Edited: The currents through arc faults are too low to be protected by breakers. This makes arc faults a serious burn/electrocution hazard. Arc fault analysis should always be used to ensure safety of the electricians. The arc fault should then be clearly labeled and the proper protective equipment should be made readily available. OSHA, NFPA, and IEEE standards should be used as the basis for proper arc fault investigation.
